## Target
Create a CNN model with the following objectives:
*    Achieve a validation accuracy of 99.4%
*    Limit the number of parameters to less than 20k
*    You have the freedom to use any techniques mentioned above.
*    Complete training in less than 20 epochs.

# Approach adopted
The approach adopted for building the model involved an iterative process while considering all the constraints. 
The entire process involved a total of 10 iterations. The focus was on making incremental improvements and exploring one step at a time. 

Please use the following links to access the logs, objectives, and observations for each iteration:

# Final Results

After completing Iteration 10, I achieved the targeted test accuracy of 99.41%. The model was able to achieve this accuracy while keeping the total parameter count to just 13,808. Furthermore, these these results were obtained within the constraint of training the model in less than 20 epochs.
