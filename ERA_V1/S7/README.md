# Assignment 7

## MNIST model training

### Target
Create a CNN model with the following objectives:
*    Achieve a validation accuracy of 99.4%
*    Limit the number of parameters to less than 8k
*    You have the freedom to use any techniques mentioned above.
*    Complete training in less than 15 epochs.

### Approach adopted
The approach adopted for building the model involved an iterative process while considering all the constraints. 
The entire process involved a total of 3 iterations. The focus was on making incremental improvements and exploring one step at a time. 

Please use the following links to access the logs, objectives, and observations for each iteration:

*   [Model 1](./s7_01.ipynb)
*   [Model 2](./s7_02.ipynb)
*   [Mode 3](./s7_03.ipynb)

These links to Notebooks will provide you with detailed information about each iteration, including the specific objectives, logs, and observations associated with it.

## Final Results

After completing Iteration 3, I achieved the targeted test accuracy of __99.42%__. The model was able to achieve this accuracy while keeping the total parameter count to just __7,288__. Furthermore, these these results were obtained within the constraint of training the model in less than __15__ epochs.
